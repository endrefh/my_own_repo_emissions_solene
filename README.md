## App Development Journal



### WEEK 5 - Task 1: Cloud environment
In Week 1 of development, we did our best to get everybody set up with Github and Heroku accounts as well as develop a group chat forum where we could stay connected and strategize around each week's tasks.

I learned to:
1. Set a cooperative codind environment and manage a project in GitHub
1. Create my logbook/diary setting via README and the important syntax.
Syntax for README edit can be found in this link [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
1. Recognize the most favorable License for my project
1. Deploy a cloud environment for running an app in Heroku
1. Create a DB to feed my app in real time

### WEEK 6 - Task 2: App Structure
This week, the app development team copied and uploaded repository files taken from Gabriel's example repository to structure our own repository. The team also created a directory tree for our repository that is located in this README file.

I learned to:
1. Upload files or copy files from a repository to my repository
I uploaded and copy the files from [Gabriel's repository](https://github.com/gabrielfuenmar/ene425_emissions_app)
1. Read a directory tree from other developers
1. Create a directory tree for my Emission's app
File Explorer > cmd > tree /a /f > tree.doc
1. Learn what is a fork in Github and what does it do
1. Create a new repository with the emissions app for my own account

### WEEK 7 - Task 3: App design

### WEEK 8 - Task 4: App deployment

### WEEK 9 - Task 5: Emissions calculation methodology (responsible diary)

### WEEK 10 - Task 6: App URL Redirection

## Emissions Methodology

### Within this section we are gathering information on emissions calculation method for transport sources:
#### CO2 emissions data 1 (from Gabriel) 

A basic understanding requires having a classification of transport as urban transport or industrial transport (e.g maritime, air).
A more segregated classification of "vehicles" under EC standards can be found at this [link](https://www.eafo.eu/knowledge-center/european-vehicle-categories), which is connected to the last study of ["Determining the environmental impacts of conventional
and alternatively fuelled vehicles through LCA"](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/sites/clima/files/transport/vehicles/docs/2020_study_main_report_en.pdf) by Ricardo Energy and Environment for the European Comission. Our observations o this study is that the segregation is practical for our purpouses, but the methodology is on a higher scale than what we are intending to do with the app (local direct emission per km rather than Life Cycle Analysis (LCA)).


#### CO2 emissions data 2 (found by another student)

[Here](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co2-transport-mode?tab=chart&stackMode=absolute&time=latest&country=Domestic%20flight~Eurostar%20(international%20rail)~Medium%20car%20(diesel)~Medium%20car%20(petrol)~Short-haul%20flight%20(economy)~Long-haul%20flight%20(economy)~Motorcycle%20(medium)~National%20rail~Bus~Small%20electric%20vehicle%20(UK%20electricity)&region=World)
        Under link we can find COâ‚‚ emissions (in grams per passenger kilometer) by mode of transport, 2018 based on data of UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS). Different modes of transport can be selected. This can serve as a basis, but can at best be supplemented by data for Norway or more up-to-date data.
